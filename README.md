## Introduction

This project is inspired by the Compound protocol, a money market protocol that allows users to lend and borrow tokens. Users can supply tokens to earn interest or borrow tokens, such as Chainlink, speculating on their price movements. The project is built using Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and Motoko, enabling efficient and scalable transactions.

## Features

- Lend and borrow tokens.
- Earn interest on supplied tokens.
- Pay interest on borrowed tokens.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
- **Smart Contracts**: Motoko
- **Frontend**: JS, HTML, CSS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   dfx start
   dfx deploy
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   dfx start
   dfx deploy
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in dfx).

## How It Works

- **Lending**: Users supply tokens to the platform and earn interest.
- **Borrowing**: Users can borrow tokens and pay interest back, speculating on price movements.
- The protocol collects interest from borrowers and distributes it to lenders, retaining a small service fee.
